# ResearchPaper101
<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Hello!!! Iâ€™m Sheiphan Joseph. Welcome to my blog, where I share my passion for artificial intelligence and its history. I have always been fascinated by how AI has evolved over the years, from the early days of symbolic logic and expert systems to the recent breakthroughs in deep learning and natural language processing. I believe that reading the original research papers that shaped AI is a great way to learn from the pioneers and understand the challenges and opportunities in this field.

That's why I decided to start a project of reading and summarizing two AI papers every week, covering a wide range of topics and methods. I will post my notes and insights on this notion page, which is open to anyone who is interested in AI research. You can find the papers I have read so far, along with links to the full texts, in the table below. I hope you will find this resource useful and informative, and feel free to leave your comments and feedback.
